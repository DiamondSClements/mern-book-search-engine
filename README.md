# mern-book-search-engine

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a full-stack application built to provide users with a seamless experience for searching and managing their book preferences.
The application utilizes a GraphQL API on the back end, replacing the previous RESTful API. Users can perform book searches, create accounts, save books to their profiles, and manage their saved book list. 
The technologies that were used are:
* React
* Apollo 
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB


## Installation
This assignment provided starter code that was retrieved from the class repository. The starter code was built with a RESTful API, and I had to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
I also had to complete the installation of Apollo Server.

## Usage 
How to use this application to search for books:
* Open the application and click on the "Search for Books" menu option.
* Enter a search term in the input field and click the "Submit Search" button.
* View the search results, each featuring a book's title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
